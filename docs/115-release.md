title: Custom releasing
---

GoRelease will create a release in GitHub with the current tag, upload all
the archives and checksums, also generating a changelog from the commit
log between the current and previous tags.

Let's see what can be customized in the `release` section:

```yml
# .goreleaser.yml
release:
  # Repo in which the release will be created.
  # Default is extracted from the origin remote URL.
  github:
    owner: user
    name: repo
    # endpoint urls for enterprise github.
    # Default is github.com.
    api_url: github api endpoint
    uploads_url: github file uploads url
    download_url github download url

  # If set to true, will not auto-publish the release.
  # Default is false
  draft: true
```

## Custom release notes

You can have a markdown file previously created with the release notes, and
pass it down to goreleaser with the `--release-notes=FILE` flag.
GoReleaser will then skip its own release notes generation,
using the contents of your file instead.
