Since [v0.74.0](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/tag/v0.74.0),
GoReleaser supports pushing artifacts to Amazon S3 and other API-compatible
block storages ([minio][] for example).

[minio]: https://www.minio.io

Right now, the implementation is quite simple and probably won't cover all
use cases. If you need one of such use cases, please open an issue/pull request.

## Customization

```yaml
# .goreleaser.yml
s3:
  # You can have multiple s3 configs
  -
    # bucket name
    bucket: my-bucket
    # region, defaults to us-east-1
    region: us-east-1
    # path inside the bucket.
    # This is parsed with the Go template engine and the following variables
    # are available:
    # - ProjectName
    # - Tag
    # - Version (Git tag without `v` prefix)
    # There is also a template function "time" that takes a Go time format
    # string to insert a formated timestamp into the release name.
    # Default is `{{ .ProjectName }}/{{ .Tag }}`
    folder: "foo/bar/{{.Version}}"
    # Endpoint allows you to set a custom endpoint, which is useful if you
    # want to push your artifacts to a minio server for example.
    endpoint: "http://minio.foo.com"
```

## Authentication

GoReleaser will authenticate using the [same methods defined by aws-cli][auth].
You can read the [docs][auth] to find out more about it.
