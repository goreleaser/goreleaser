Sometimes we want to generate a full build of our project,
but neither want to validate anything nor upload it to anywhere.
GoReleaser supports this with the `--snapshot` flag
and also with the `snapshot` customization section:

```yml
# .goreleaser.yml
snapshot:
  # Allows you to change the name of the generated snapshot
  # releases. The following variables are available:
  # - Commit
  # - Tag
  # - Timestamp
  # Default is `SNAPSHOT-{{.Commit}}`.
  name_template: SNAPSHOT-{{.Commit}}
```
