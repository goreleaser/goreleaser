# Deprecation notices

This page is used to list deprecation notices across GoReleaser.

Deprecated options are only removed on major versions of GoReleaser.

Nevertheless, it's a good thing to keep your configuration up-to-date to prevent
any issues.

You can check your use of deprecated configurations by running:

```sh
goreleaser check
```

### dockers

We're re-implementing the docker feature from the ground up.

The configuration now is way more concise, and the implementation is simpler as
well.

Before, you would have to setup `dockers` and `docker_manifests`, now, only
`dockers` (provisionally being called `dockers_v2`).

Then, instead of building the images, pushing them, and then building the
manifests and pushing them, we will now run a single `docker buildx build` with
the given platforms, which it'll build and publish the manifest.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    dockers:
      - image_templates:
          - "foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-amd64"
          - "ghcr.io/foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-amd64"
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
        use: buildx
        build_flag_templates:
          - "--pull"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.description=Foo bar"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.created={{.Date}}"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.name={{.ProjectName}}"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.revision={{.FullCommit}}"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.version={{.Version}}"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.source={{.GitURL}}"
          - "--platform=linux/amd64"
      - image_templates:
          - "foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-arm64"
          - "ghcr.io/foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-arm64"
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
        use: buildx
        build_flag_templates:
          - "--pull"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.description=Foo bar"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.created={{.Date}}"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.name={{.ProjectName}}"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.revision={{.FullCommit}}"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.version={{.Version}}"
          - "--label=org.opencontainers.image.source={{.GitURL}}"
          - "--platform=linux/arm64"
        goarch: arm64

    docker_manifests:
      - name_template: "foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}"
        image_templates:
          - "foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-amd64"
          - "foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-arm64"
      - name_template: "ghcr.io/foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}"
        image_templates:
          - "ghcr.io/foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-amd64"
          - "ghcr.io/foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-arm64"
      - name_template: "{{ if not .IsNightly }}foo/bar:latest{{ end }}"
        image_templates:
          - "foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-amd64"
          - "foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-arm64"
      - name_template: "{{ if not .IsNightly }}ghcr.io/foo/bar:latest{{ end }}"
        image_templates:
          - "ghcr.io/foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-amd64"
          - "ghcr.io/foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-arm64"
      - name_template: "{{ if .IsNightly }}foo/bar:nightly{{ end }}"
        image_templates:
          - "foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-amd64"
          - "foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-arm64"
      - name_template: "{{ if .IsNightly }}ghcr.io/foo/bar:nightly{{ end }}"
        image_templates:
          - "ghcr.io/foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-amd64"
          - "ghcr.io/foo/bar:v{{ .Version }}-arm64"
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    dockers_v2:
      - images:
          - "foo/bar"
          - "ghcr.io/foo/bar"
        tags:
          - "v{{ .Version }}"
          - "{{ if .IsNightly }}nightly{{ end }}"
          - "{{ if not .IsNightly }}latest{{ end }}"
        labels:
          "org.opencontainers.image.description": "Foo bar"
          "org.opencontainers.image.created": "{{.Date}}"
          "org.opencontainers.image.name": "{{.ProjectName}}"
          "org.opencontainers.image.revision": "{{.FullCommit}}"
          "org.opencontainers.image.version": "{{.Version}}"
          "org.opencontainers.image.source": "{{.GitURL}}"
    ```

As you can see, it's a lot simpler. The resulting images are the same, a
combination of all the non-empty images with all the non-empty tags.

This will also require a small change in your `Dockerfile` when copying from the
context:

=== "Before"

    ```dockerfile
    FROM alpine
    COPY my-binary /usr/bin
    ```

=== "After"

    ```dockerfile
    FROM alpine
    ARG TARGETPLATFORM
    COPY $TARGETPLATFORM/my-binary /usr/bin
    ```

GoReleaser will automatically setup the context in such a way that all the
artifacts for the given target platform will be located within
`$TARGETPLATFORM/`.

One side effect of this new feature is that builds with `--snapshot` will
produce images that cannot be ran, and thus it only tests the `docker build`
itself.
This is something we're actively working on.

Feel free to suggest improvements
[here](http://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/discussions/XYZ)

Regarding signing, you may also remove the `artifacts` option from you
`docker_signs`:

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    docker_signs:
      - artifacts: images
        # etc..
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    docker_signs:
      - # etc..
    ```

### homebrew_casks.conflicts.formula

> since v2.12-unreleased

It was a no-op before, and is now
[removed from Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20499).

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    homebrew_casks:
    - conflicts:
      - formula: foo
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    homebrew_casks:
    - {}
    ```

### homebrew_casks.manpage

> since v2.11

You may now define multiple man pages, which was not possible in v2.10.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    homebrew_casks:
    - manpage: foo.1.gz
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    homebrew_casks:
    - manpages:
      - foo.1.gz
    ```

### brews

> since v2.10

Historically, GoReleaser would generate _hackyish_ formulas that would install
the pre-compiled binaries.
This was the only way to do it for Linuxbrew at the time, but this is no longer
true, and _Casks_ should be used instead.

That said, we now have a `homebrew_casks` section!

For simple cases, simply replacing one with the other will be good enough.
More complex settings might require further change.
Check the [new documentation](./customization/homebrew_casks.md) for more
details.

Once you do the first release this way, you might also want to delete the old
_Formulas_ from your _Tap_.
You may also want to make the _Cask_ conflict with the previous _Formula_.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    brews:
    - name: foo
      directory: Formulas
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    homebrew_casks:
    - name: foo
      # Optional: either set it to Casks, or remove it:
      directory: Casks

      # Optional: helps pass `homebrew audit` if homepage is different from download domain:
      url:
        verified: github.com/myorg/myrepo

      # Optional: if your app/binary isn't signed and notarized, you'll need this:
      hooks:
        post:
          # replace foo with the actual binary name
          install: |
            if OS.mac?
              system_command "/usr/bin/xattr", args: ["-dr", "com.apple.quarantine", "#{staged_path}/foo"]
            end
    ```

!!! warning

    Don't forget to remove the `directory: Formula` from your configuration.
    Casks **need** to be in the `Casks` directory - which is the default.

I would also recommend manually editing your Formula to disable it, e.g.:

```ruby
class Foo < Formula
  # ...
  # make sure to bump the version:
  version "1.2.3"
  # ...
  disable! date: "2025-06-10", because: "the cask should be used now instead", replacement_cask: "foo"
  # ...
end
```

With this, when the user tries to upgrade, they should see and error like so:

```
==> Upgrading 1 outdated package:
goreleaser/tap/goreleaser 2.9.0 -> 2.9.1
Error: goreleaser/tap/goreleaser has been disabled because it the cask should be used now instead! It will be disabled on 2025-06-14.
Replacement:
  brew install --cask goreleaser
```

### archives.builds

> since v2.8

The `builds` field has been replaced with the `ids`, which is the nomenclature
used everywhere else.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    archives:
      builds: [a, b]
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    archives:
      ids: [a, b]
    ```

### snaps.builds

> since v2.8

The `builds` field has been replaced with the `ids`, which is the nomenclature
used everywhere else.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    snaps:
      builds: [a, b]
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    snaps:
      ids: [a, b]
    ```

### nfpms.builds

> since v2.8

The `builds` field has been replaced with the `ids`, which is the nomenclature
used everywhere else.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    nfpms:
      builds: [a, b]
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    nfpms:

    ```

### archives.format

> since v2.6

Format was renamed to `formats`, and now accepts a list of formats.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    archives:
      - format: zip
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    archives:
      - formats: [ 'zip' ]
    ```

!!! tip

    It will still accept a single string, e.g.: `formats: zip`.
    In most cases you can simply rename the property to formats.

### archives.format_overrides.format

> since v2.6

Format was renamed to `formats`, and now accepts a list of formats.

!!! tip

    It will still accept a single string, e.g.: `formats: zip`.
    In most cases you can simply rename the property to formats.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    archives:
      - format_overrides:
        - format: zip
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    archives:
      - format_overrides:
        - formats: [ 'zip' ]
    ```

!!! tip

    It will still accept a single string, e.g.: `formats: zip`.
    In most cases you can simply rename the property to formats.

### kos.repository

> since v2.5

Use `repositories` instead. It allows to create multiple images with Ko, without
having to rebuild each of them.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    kos:
      - repository: foo/bar
    ```

=== "After"

    ```

### kos.sbom

> since v2.2

Ko removed support for `cyclonedx` and `go.version-m` SBOMs from upstream.
You can now either use `spdx` or `none`.
From now on, these two options will be replaced by `none`.
We recommend you change it to `spdx`.

### nightly.name_template

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    nightly:
      name_template: 'foo'

### `--skip`

> since 2023-09-14 (v1.21), removed 2024-05-26 (v2.0)

The following `goreleaser release` flags were deprecated:

- `--skip-announce`
- `--skip-before`
- `--skip-docker`
- `--skip-ko`
- `--skip-publish`
- `--skip-sbom`
- `--skip-sign`
- `--skip-validate`

By the same token, the following `goreleaser build` flags were deprecated:

- `--skip-before`
- `--skip-post-hooks`
- `--skip-validate`

All these flags are now under a single `--skip` flag, that accepts multiple
values.

=== "Before"

    ```sh
    goreleaser build --skip-before --skip-validate
    goreleaser release --skip-validate --skip-publish
    ```

=== "After"

    goreleaser build --skip=before,validate
    goreleaser release --skip=validate,publish

    # or

    goreleaser build --skip=before --skip=validate
    goreleaser release --skip=validate --skip=publish
    ```

You can check `goreleaser build --help` and `goreleaser release --help` to see
the valid options, and shell autocompletion should work properly as well.

### scoops.bucket

### brews.plist

> since 2023-06-06 (v1.19.0), removed 2024-05-26 (v2.0)

`plist` is deprecated by Homebrew, and now on GoReleaser too. Use `service`
instead.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    brews:
    -
      plist: |
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
        <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
        # etc ...
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    brews:
    -
      service: |
        run [opt_bin/"mybin"]
        keep_alive true
        # etc ...
    ```

### --debug

> since 2023-05-16 (v1.19.0), removed 2024-05-26 (v2.0)

    ```bash
    goreleaser release --debug
    ```

=== "After"

    ```bash
    goreleaser release --verbose
    ```

### scoop

> since 2023-04-30 (v1.18.0), removed 2024-05-26 (v2.0)

GoReleaser now allows many `scoop` configurations, so it should be pluralized
[accordingly](customization/scoop.md).

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    scoop:
      # ...
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml

> since 2023-02-09 (v1.16.0), removed 2024-05-26 (v2.0)

This option was still being supported, even though undocumented, for a couple
of years now. It's finally time to sunset it.

Simply use the pluralized form, `builds`, according to the
[documentation](./customization/builds/index.md).

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    build:
      # ...
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    builds:
    - # ...
    ```

### --rm-dist

> since 2023-01-17 (v1.15.0), removed 2024-05-26 (v2.0)

`--rm-dist` has been deprecated in favor of `--clean`.

=== "Before"

    ```bash
    goreleaser release --rm-dist
    ```

=== "After"

    ```bash
    goreleaser release --clean
    ```

### nfpms.maintainer

> since 2022-05-07 (v1.9.0), removed 2024-05-26 (v2.0)

nFPM will soon make mandatory setting the maintainer field.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml
    nfpms:
    - maintainer: ''
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml
    nfpms:
    - maintainer: 'Name <email>'
    ```

## Previous versions

Deprecations that were removed in v1.x or earlier have been moved into its [own page](./old-deprecations.md).
