# Announcing GoReleaser v2.11

This version consists mostly of improvements to the [Homebrew Cask][casks]
feature introduced in the last release, and in other features.

<!-- more -->

- **pro**: added `republish` to [Cloudsmiths][cloudsmith];
- **pro**: `publishers` get a `output` option, which sets the output of the
  command as a template variable with that name (e.g. `output: foo` allows you
  to use `{{ .Outputs.foo }}`);
- **pro**: it will now allow to create nightly releases when there's no tags in
  the repository yet;
- **cask**: moved `custom_block` to the beginning of the Cask, renamed `manpage`
  to `manpages` to better match the Cask API, and added docs on how to make
  Casks for private repositories;
- **git**: you can now setup commit signing when publishing to a git repository;
- **ui**: the `--help` now looks a bit better, and we also improved the program
  output in a few places;
- **cleanups**: made a few improvements on how context cancellation works (i.e.
  on timeouts or `SIGINT`), removed the usage of some libraries, and many other
  smaller changes;
