# Announcing GoReleaser v2.13

After a couple of months, v2.13 is here!

<!-- more -->

First of all, sorry for the delay releasing this minor.
In my defense, I was really busy: Golab in Italy, GitHub Universe in San
Francisco, plus a bunch of other stuff - and also, bugs kept getting fixed in
the meantime!

Anyway, here we go!

## All about MCP

Big news here!

First, GoReleaser now supports publishing MCPs to the GitHub MCP registry!

See this example:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
mcp:
  name: "io.github.goreleaser/mcp"
  title: "The MCP server for GoReleaser"
  repository:
    source: "github"
    url: "https://github.com/goreleaser/mcp"
  auth:
    type: "github-oidc"
  packages:
    - registry_type: oci
      identifier: "ghcr.io/goreleaser/mcp:{{ .Version }}"
      transport:
        type: stdio
    - registry_type: npm
      identifier: "@goreleaser/mcp"
      transport:
        type: stdio
```

And the second news is that the GoReleaser MCP now has its own repository.
This should allow us to evolve it faster, and also, if you only want the MCP,
the binary is much smaller.

## GoReleaser Pro

For Pro users, the NPM feature got some improvements: you can now set the NPM
tag (instead of defaulting to latest), so you may have
`npm install yourthing@beta`, for example.
You can also set extra fields into the `package.json`, which is specially
relevant for the aforementioned MCP feature.

Example:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
npms:
  - name: "@foo/bar"
    extra:
      mcpName: "io.github.foo/bar"
```

[NPM documentation](https://goreleaser.com/customization/npm).

Finally, you can use the fields from the [global metadata](https://goreleaser.com/customization/metadata)
in your templates, e.g.:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
metadata:
  description: Foo bar zaz
dockers_v2:
  - images:
      - "ghcr.io/foo/bar"
    labels:
      "org.opencontainers.image.description": "{{.Metadata.Description}}"
```

## Dockers v2

We continue investing in the
[dockers_v2](https://goreleaser.com/customization/dockers_v2) feature, and since
v2.12.0 we made **a lot** of improvements:

1. allow `linux/arm/v5`
1. allow to disable SBOMs
1. allow to template the `sbom` field
1. allow to disable a configuration
1. properly handle `--split` (on Pro)
1. respect `monorepo.dir` (on Pro)
1. properly set manifest annotations
1. properly support PyWheel
1. improve error handling

## Other highlights

- **aur**: [AUR](https://goreleaser.com/customization/aur) will now use `${pkgver}` in the URLs to generate smaller diffs
- **announce**: [Discourse announcer](https://goreleaser.com/customization/announce/discourse/)
- **homebrew_casks,signs,docker_sigs**: You can now template `hooks` in
  `homebrew_casks` and `output` in `signs` and `docker_signs`
- **homebrew_casks**: set more than one binary
- **ko**: [Ko](https://goreleaser.com/customization/ko) can now use a local base image
- **sbom**: make `--enrich=all` a default flag
- **makeself**: properly handle binary and script names
- **npm**: properly handle HTTP/HTTPS proxies
