# Announcing GoReleaser v2.4

New release coming in hot!

<!-- more -->

- **new**: create macOS app bundles. Initially they are only usable with `dmgs`,
  more uses might be added in the future. (only on [pro][])
  Example:
  ```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
  app_bundles:
    - bundle: com.goreleaser.goreleaser
      icon: www/docs/static/goreleaser.icns
      if: '{{eq .Arch "all"}}'
  dmg:
    - name: goreleaser
      use: appbundle
  ```

- **new**: `nfpms` and `dmgs` get an `if` field, which allows to further filter
  artifacts. (only on [pro][])
- **new**: `dmgs` get an `templated_extra_files` field. (only on [pro][])
- **new**: `kos` gets support for setting annotations and user.
- **new**: support for `GO386`, `GOARM64`, `GOMIPS64`, `GORISCV64`, and
  `GOPPC64`, as well as new template variables for each of them.
- **new**: [experimental][] change of default `GOARM` to `7` instead of `6`.
- **new**: we are testing using [Dagger][] to run our test pipeline. Thanks to
  the Dagger team for working on it, especially Kyle, Lev, and Marcos.

As always, bug fixes, dependency updates, housekeeping, and documentation
updates are included in this release as well.
