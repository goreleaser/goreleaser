# Announcing GoReleaser v2.2

Another month, another minor release full of improvements!

<!-- more -->

- **new**: `binary_signs` allows to sign binaries before archiving them
- **new**: `signs.if`, `binary_signs.if`, `docker_signs.if` allows to further
  filter artifacts using template expressions (only on [pro][])
- **new**: `list` and `in` template functions
- **new**: `--skip=report-sizes`
- **new**: `--clean` will now remove `./dist` **before** checking if the current
  git state
- **gitlab**: fixed release file URL
- **templates**: fixed `isEnvSet` and `envOrDefault` not working in some cases
- **ko**: clarified an error message, also `cyclonedx` and `go.version-m`
  support was removed from upstream, so we removed it here too
- **deprecated**: `nightly.name_template` -> `nightly.version_template`
- **deprecated**: `snapshot.name_template` -> `snapshot.version_template`

As always, bug fixes, dependency updates, housekeeping, and documentation
updates are included in this release as well.
