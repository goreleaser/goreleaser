# Welcome to our new blog

We are in the process of migrating our blog from Medium to here.

<!-- more -->

Medium is proprietary, and I don't particularly like it very much.

Now that [material-mkdocs][] has a blog feature, I started migrating the blog to
here.

You can follow the progress in [this issue](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3503).

You can also subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed_rss_created.xml)!

Thanks, I hope you enjoy the new home. ðŸ˜„
