# Announcing GoReleaser v1.21 - mostly bug fixes

A boring release, mostly bug fixes.
Boring is good.

<!-- more -->

## Highlights

- You can now sort tags by `semver` in [GoReleaser Pro][pro]
- Docker pushes will now be retried when the registry yields a 503. It'll retry
  10 times.
- Winget: added support for `package_dependencies` and update schema version to
  1.5.0.
- GoReleaser will now run against Gerrit, Soft-Serve, and other Git providers,
  as long as the SCM release is disabled.
- You can now ignore Git tags that match a regular expression.
- You can now skip pre build hooks on `goreleaser build`.
- Properly `go mod` handling on pre-mods Go versions.
- WASI support.
- New templateable fields and functions.
- Several bug fixes, specially when the runtime OS is Windows.

Besides that, some important refactories that should help evolving GoReleaser
further:

- `--skip` merges all the `--skip-*` flags, and will be extended to more
  features (open an issue requesting what you need ðŸ“©).
- Template error handling was improved.
- We also updated GoReleaser to Go 1.21.

And, as always, several bug fixes and documentation updates!

## Windows

GoReleaser was never properly tested on Windows. It somewhat works, but there
are potentially many rough edges.

[I started trying to make CI pass on Windows](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/pull/4293).
It's a bit hard to evolve it as I don't really use Windows, so I have to juggle
around VMs and/or CI.

If you use Windows regularly and want to contribute, ping me on our
[Discord][discord], I'm happy to help you in any way I need, especially if you
are a beginner in the field and/or Go.
