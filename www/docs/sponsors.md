Does you or your company use GoReleaser?
You can help keep the project bug-free and feature rich by sponsoring the project and the maintainers.

## GitHub Sponsors

GitHub Sponsors is a great way to contribute directly to the main maintainer, [caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0).

This money usually goes to buying coffee, beer, better hardware, and, hopefully, one day, paying the bills.

You can sponsor and see who's sponsoring Carlos [here](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0).

## OpenCollective

OpenCollective is a great way to send some money towards the GoReleaser organization.

This ultimately is used to buy/renew domains, keep servers up (although right now we're on free plans), print and send stickers to other contributors among other things.

You can start sponsoring at the [OpenCollective website](https://opencollective.com/goreleaser).

Below you can see a list of the current sponsors and backers on OpenCollective:
