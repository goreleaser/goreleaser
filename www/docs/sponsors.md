# Sponsors

Do you or your company use GoReleaser?
You can help keep the project bug-free and feature rich by sponsoring the
project and its maintainers.

## GitHub Sponsors

GitHub Sponsors is a great way to contribute directly to the GoReleaser
maintainer, [caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0).

This money usually goes to buying coffee, beer, better hardware, and, hopefully,
one day, paying the bills.

### High-tier sponsors

And, of course, you can also sponsor any of
[contributors](https://github.com/orgs/goreleaser/people) in whatever way they
prefer it!

## OpenCollective

OpenCollective is a great way to send some money towards the GoReleaser
organization.

This ultimately is used to buy/renew domains, keep servers up, print and send
stickers to contributors and users, among other things.

You can start sponsoring at the
[OpenCollective website](https://opencollective.com/goreleaser).

Below you can see a list of the current sponsors and backers on OpenCollective:
