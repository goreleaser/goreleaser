# How to add a new cookbook

1. Create a new markdown file inside `www/docs/cookbooks` with the content you want;
2. Add it to `www/mkdocs.yml`, under the `Cookbooks` section;
3. Open a pull request with these changes;
4. That's it!

You can also test your changes locally by running `make serve` and browsing `http://localhost:8000`.
