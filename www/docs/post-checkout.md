# Thanks for subscribing to GoReleaser Pro! ðŸ¥³

A few notes on how to get started:

- [x] if you use GitHub Actions, make sure to set the `distribution` option to
      `pro`. Don't forget to add the `GORELEASER_KEY` environment variable as
      well.[^actions]
- [x] if you installed GoReleaser via a package manager, you'll need to install
      a different package. Usually it's the same name as the OSS, but with a
      `-pro` suffix, e.g. `goreleaser-pro` instead of `goreleaser`.[^install]
- [x] Once you install the Pro version, you can set the `GORELEASER_KEY`
      environment variable according to your shell of choice, and use it the
      same way you use the OSS version â€” with all the extra features!
- [x] If you use the YAML Language Server in your editor, check out the Pro
      JSONSchema, so you can have some instant feedback on options.[^schema]
- [x] If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact in the email
      you received or on any of the public chats we have.[^links]

I hope GoReleaser Pro helps improving your release workflow even more!

Thank you!
