# Snapcraft Packages (snaps)

GoReleaser can also generate `snap` packages.
[Snaps](http://snapcraft.io/) are a new packaging format, that will let you
publish your project directly to the Ubuntu store.
From there it will be installable in all the
[supported Linux distros](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install), with
automatic and transactional updates.

You can read more about it in the [snapcraft docs](https://snapcraft.io/docs/).

Available options:

```yaml
# .goreleaser.yaml
snapcrafts:
  -
    # ID of the snapcraft config, must be unique.
    # Defaults to "default".
    id: foo

    # Build IDs for the builds you want to create snapcraft packages for.
    # Defaults to all builds.
    builds:
    - foo
    - bar

    # You can change the name of the package.
    # Default: `{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}{{ if .Arm }}v{{ .Arm }}{{ end }}{{ if .Mips }}_{{ .Mips }}{{ end }}`
    name_template: "{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}"

    # Replacements for GOOS and GOARCH in the package name.
    # Keys should be valid GOOSs or GOARCHs.
    # Values are the respective replacements.
    # Default is empty.
    replacements:
      amd64: 64-bit
      386: 32-bit
      darwin: macOS
      linux: Tux

    # The name of the snap. This is optional.
    # Default is project name.
    name: drumroll

    # Whether to publish the snap to the snapcraft store.
    # Remember you need to `snapcraft login` first.
    # Defaults to false.
    publish: true

    # Single-line elevator pitch for your amazing snap.
    # 79 char long at most.
    summary: Software to create fast and easy drum rolls.

    # This the description of your snap. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
    # most important story about your snap. Keep it under 100 words though,
    # we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the snap
    # store.
    description: This is the best drum roll application out there. Install it and awe!

    # Channels in store where snap will be pushed.
    # Default depends on grade:
    # * `stable` = ["edge", "beta", "candidate", "stable"]
    # * `devel` = ["edge", "beta"]
    # More info about channels here:
    # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/channels
    channel_templates:
      - edge
      - beta
      - candidate
      - stable
      - {{ .Major }}.{{ .Minor }}/edge
      - {{ .Major }}.{{ .Minor }}/beta
      - {{ .Major }}.{{ .Minor }}/candidate
      - {{ .Major }}.{{ .Minor }}/stable

    # A guardrail to prevent you from releasing a snap to all your users before
    # it is ready.
    # `devel` will let you release only to the `edge` and `beta` channels in the
    # store. `stable` will let you release also to the `candidate` and `stable`
    # channels.
    grade: stable

    # Snaps can be setup to follow three different confinement policies:
    # `strict`, `devmode` and `classic`. A strict confinement where the snap
    # can only read and write in its own namespace is recommended. Extra
    # permissions for strict snaps can be declared as `plugs` for the app, which
    # are explained later. More info about confinement here:
    # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/confinement
    confinement: strict

    # Your app's license, based on SPDX license expressions: https://spdx.org/licenses
    # Default is empty.

    # A snap of type base to be used as the execution environment for this snap.
    # Valid values are:
    # * bare - Empty base snap;

    # Default is empty.

    # Add extra files on the resulting snap. Useful for including wrapper
    # scripts or other useful static files. Source filenames are relative to the

    # With layouts, you can make elements in $SNAP, $SNAP_DATA, $SNAP_COMMON
    # accessible from locations such as /usr, /var and /etc. This helps when using
    # pre-compiled binaries and libraries that expect to find files and
    # directories outside of locations referenced by $SNAP or $SNAP_DATA.
    # About snap environment variables:
    # * HOME: set to SNAP_USER_DATA for all commands
    # * SNAP: read-only install directory
    # * SNAP_ARCH: the architecture of device (eg, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, etc)
    # * SNAP_DATA: writable area for a particular revision of the snap
    # * SNAP_COMMON: writable area common across all revisions of the snap
    # * SNAP_LIBRARY_PATH: additional directories which should be added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    # * SNAP_NAME: snap name
    # * SNAP_INSTANCE_NAME: snap instance name incl. instance key if one is set (snapd 2.36+)
    # * SNAP_INSTANCE_KEY: instance key if any (snapd 2.36+)
    # * SNAP_REVISION: store revision of the snap
    # * SNAP_USER_DATA: per-user writable area for a particular revision of the snap
    # * SNAP_USER_COMMON: per-user writable area common across all revisions of the snap
    # * SNAP_VERSION: snap version (from snap.yaml)
    # More info about layout here:
    # https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-layouts
    # Default is empty.
    layout:
      # The path you want to access in sandbox.
      /etc/drumroll:

        # Which outside file or directory you want to map to sandbox.
        # Valid keys are:
