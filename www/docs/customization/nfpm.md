# Linux packages (via nFPM)

GoReleaser can be wired to [nfpm](https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm) to
generate and publish `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.apk`, `.ipk`, and Archlinux packages.

Available options:

```yaml
# .goreleaser.yaml
nfpms:
  # note that this is an array of nfpm configs
  - #

    # You can change the file name of the package.
    #
    # Default: '{{ .PackageName }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}{{ with .Arm }}v{{ . }}{{ end }}{{ with .Mips }}_{{ . }}{{ end }}{{ if not (eq .Amd64 "v1") }}{{ .Amd64 }}{{ end }}'.

    # Build IDs for the builds you want to create NFPM packages for.
    # Default: '' (no filtering).

    # Allows to further filter the artifacts.

    # Artifacts that do not match this expression will be ignored.

!!! info

    Fields marked with "overridable" can be overridden for any format.

## Signing key passphrases

GoReleaser will try to get the password from the following environment
variables, in the following order of preference:

1. `$NFPM_[ID]_[FORMAT]_PASSPHRASE`
1. `$NFPM_[ID]_PASSPHRASE`
1. `$NFPM_PASSPHRASE`

Basically, it'll start from the most specific to the most generic.
Also, `[ID]` is the uppercase `id` value, and `[FORMAT]` is the uppercase format
(`deb`, `rpm`, etc).

So, if your `nfpms.id` is `default`, then the deb-specific passphrase
will be set `$NFPM_DEFAULT_DEB_PASSPHRASE`. GoReleaser will try that, then
`$NFPM_DEFAULT_PASSPHRASE`, and finally, `$NFPM_PASSPHRASE`.

## A note about Termux

Termux is the same format as `deb`, the differences are:

- it uses a different `bindir` (prefixed with `/data/data/com.termux/files/`)
- it uses slightly different architecture names than Debian
- it will only package binaries built for Android

## Conventional file names, Debian, and ARMv6

On Debian, both ARMv6 and ARMv7 have the same architecture name: `armhf`.

If you use `{{.ConventionalFileName}}`, and build for both architectures, you'll
get duplicated file names.

You can go around that with something like this:

```yaml
# .goreleaser.yaml
nfpms:
  - # ...
    file_name_template: >-
      {{- trimsuffix .ConventionalFileName .ConventionalExtension -}}
      {{- if and (eq .Arm "6") (eq .ConventionalExtension ".deb") }}6{{ end -}}
      {{- if not (eq .Amd64 "v1")}}{{ .Amd64 }}{{ end -}}
      {{- .ConventionalExtension -}}

    # ...
```
