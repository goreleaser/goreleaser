# Homebrew Casks

<!-- md:version v2.10 -->

After releasing to GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea, GoReleaser can generate and publish
a _Homebrew Cask_ into a repository (_Tap_) that you have access to.

The `homebrew_casks` section specifies how the cask should be created.
You can check the
[Homebrew Cask documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Cask-Cookbook),
for more details.

    #
    # Default: the project name.
    # Templates: allowed.

    # Alternative names for the current cask.
    #
    # Useful if you want to publish a versioned cask as well, so users can
    # more easily downgrade.
    #
    # This feature is only available in GoReleaser Pro.

    # App to use instead of the binary.

    # Path to the manpage files.

    # Setting this will prevent goreleaser to actually try to commit the updated

## Signing and Notarizing

Casks are supposed to be signed, even if they are coming from a tap.

GoReleaser can [sign and notarize both binaries and apps](./notarize.md), but,
Apple charges a yearly fee for that.

If you don't want to do it, you still have the option to tell macOS to remove
the quarantine bit from the binary on a post install hook:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
homebrew_casks:
  - name: foo
    hooks:
      post:
        # replace foo with the actual binary name
        install: |
          if OS.mac?
            system_command "/usr/bin/xattr", args: ["-dr", "com.apple.quarantine", "#{staged_path}/foo"]
          end
```

!!! danger "What happens if I don't follow the steps above?"

    **Not following this might lead to your app/binary to not run.**

    In these cases, users will see the infamous "_App Name is damaged and
    cannot be opened_" alert.

    If you don't want to do any of the steps above, you may want to instruct
    your users to run the appropriate `xattr` command manually.

    You may do so in using the `caveats` property, for example.

!!! warning "xattr bypasses macOS security - use with caution"

    Use of `xattr` to bypass Gatekeeper circumvents macOS security protections
    designed to verify software authenticity. This removes Apple's verification
    layer and requires users to trust the software directly.

    Proper code signing and notarization is Apple's recommended method for
    distributing software. This approach should only be considered when code
    signing is not feasible.

    Important: Apple may disable this bypass method in future macOS versions
    without notice, potentially breaking software distribution that relies on it.

## Versioned Casks

<!-- md:pro -->

GoReleaser can also create a versioned Cask.
For instance, you might want to make keep previous minor versions available to
your users, so they easily downgrade and/or keep using an older version.

To do that, use `alternative_names`:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
homebrew_casks:
  - name: foo
    alternative_names:
      - "foo@{{ .Major }}.{{ .Minor }}"
    # other fields
```

So, if you tag `v1.2.3`, GoReleaser will create and push `foo.rb` and
`foo@1.2.rb`.

Later on, you can tag `v1.3.0`, and then GoReleaser will create and push both
`foo.rb` (thus overriding the previous version) and `foo@1.3.rb`.
Your users can then `brew install foo@1.2` to keep using the previous version.

## GitHub Actions

To publish a cask from one repository to another using GitHub Actions, you
cannot use the default action token. You must use a separate token with content
write privileges for the tap repository. You can check the
[resource not accessible by integration](https://goreleaser.com/errors/resource-not-accessible-by-integration/)
for more information.

## Private GitHub Repositories

The best way to support private repositories is to add by using a custom block,
a custom template URL, and custom headers.

Here's an example:

!!! warning

    Please note that this example uses an internal Homebrew API to retrieve the GitHub API token.

    Replace with your implementation as needed.

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
homebrew_casks:
  - name: foo
    custom_block: |
      module GitHubHelper
        def self.token
          require "utils/github"

          # Prefer environment variable if available
          github_token = ENV["HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN"]
          github_token ||= GitHub::API.credentials
          raise "Failed to retrieve github api token" if github_token.nil? || github_token.empty?

          github_token
        end

        def self.release_asset_url(tag, name)
          require "json"
          require "net/http"
          require "uri"

          resp = Net::HTTP.get(
            # Replace with your GitHub repository URL
            URI.parse("https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/example/releases/tags/#{tag}"),
            {
              "Accept" => "application/vnd.github+json",
              "Authorization" => "Bearer #{token}",
              "X-GitHub-Api-Version" => "2022-11-28"
            }
          )

          release = JSON.parse(resp)
          release["assets"].find { |asset| asset["name"] == name }["url"]
        end
      end

    url:
      template: '#{GitHubHelper.release_asset_url("{{.Tag}}", "{{.ArtifactName}}")}'
      headers:
        - "Accept: application/octet-stream"
        - "Authorization: Bearer #{GitHubHelper.token}"
        - "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"
```
