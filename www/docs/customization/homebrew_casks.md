# Homebrew Casks

<!-- md:version v2.10-unreleased -->

After releasing to GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea, GoReleaser can generate and publish
a _Homebrew Cask_ into a repository (_Tap_) that you have access to.

The `homebrew_casks` section specifies how the cask should be created.
You can check the
[Homebrew Cask documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Cask-Cookbook),
for more details.

## Versioned Casks

<!-- md:pro -->

GoReleaser can also create a versioned Cask.
For instance, you might want to make keep previous minor versions available to
your users, so they easily downgrade and/or keep using an older version.

To do that, use `alternative_names`:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
homebrew_casks:
  - name: foo
    alternative_names:
      - "foo@{{ .Major }}.{{ .Minor }}"
    # other fields
```

So, if you tag `v1.2.3`, GoReleaser will create and push `foo.rb` and
`foo@1.2.rb`.

Later on, you can tag `v1.3.0`, and then GoReleaser will create and push both
`foo.rb` (thus overriding the previous version) and `foo@1.3.rb`.
Your users can then `brew install foo@1.2` to keep using the previous version.

## GitHub Actions

To publish a cask from one repository to another using GitHub Actions, you cannot use the default action token.
You must use a separate token with content write privileges for the tap repository.
You can check the [resource not accessible by integration](https://goreleaser.com/errors/resource-not-accessible-by-integration/) for more information.

## Limitations

- Only one `GOARM` build is allowed;
