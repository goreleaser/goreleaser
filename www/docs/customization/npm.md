# NPM

<!-- md:version v2.8 -->

<!-- md:pro -->

The `npms` section configures how GoReleaser publishes your packages to NPM
registries.

## How it works

You can declare multiple NPM instances.
All binaries generated by your `builds` section will be available for use in
your NPM packages.

For each NPM configuration, GoReleaser will:

1. Generate a `package.json` file and other required scripts based on your
   configuration;
1. When the user `npm i -g` or `npx` your package, a `postinstall` script will
   download the archive, and extract/copy the binaries into the `./bin` folder;
1. Publish the package to a NPM registry (`npmjs.com` by default, customize with
   `npm config`).

!!! warning "Caveat"

    This will not work if the user installs with `--ignore-scripts`.

## Supported platforms and formats

Initially, we are supporting the following platforms:

- `linux`: `amd64` and `arm64`
- `darwin`: `amd64` and `arm64`
- `windows`: `amd64` and `arm64`

And these archive formats:

- `tgz`, `tar.gz`
- `tar`
- `zip`
- `binary`

More formats and platforms might be added in the future.

## Why NPM?

Basically, to increase the distribution of your app.

Many people have `npm` and `npx` installed, and are used to
`npm i -g <package>`.

Its technically a hack, but works in most cases.

Its worth noting its still in an alpha state.
Feel free to provide feedback if you find issues or know ways in which it could
be improved.
