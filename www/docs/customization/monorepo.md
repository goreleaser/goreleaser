# Monorepo

!!! success "GoReleaser Pro"
    The monorepo support is a [GoReleaser Pro feature](/pro/).

If you want to use GoReleaser within a monorepo and use tag prefixes to mark "which tags belong to which sub project", GoReleaser got you covered.

## Premise

You create your tags like `subproject1/v1.2.3` and `subproject2/v1.2.3`.

## Usage

You'll need to create a `.goreleaser.yaml` for each subproject you want to use GoReleaser in:

```yaml
# subroj1/.goreleaser.yaml
project_name: subproj1

monorepo:
  tag_prefix: subproject1/
  dir: subproj1
```

Then, you can release with (from the project's root directory):

```sh
goreleaser release --rm-dist -f ./subproj1/.goreleaser.yaml
```

Then, the following is different from a "regular" run:

- GoReleaser will then look if current commit has a tag prefixed with `subproject1`, and also the previous tag with the same prefix;
- Changelog will include only commits that contain changes to files within the `subproj1` directory;
- Release name gets prefixed with `{{ .ProjectName }} ` if empty;
- All build's `dir` setting get set to `monorepo.dir` if empty;
  - if yours is not, you might want to change that manually;
- Extra files on the release, archives, Docker builds, etc are prefixed with `monorepo.dir`;
- On templates, `{{.PrefixedTag}}` will be `monorepo.prefix/tag` (aka the actual tag name), and `{{.Tag}}` has the prefix stripped;

The rest of the release process should work as usual.

!!! warning
    This feature is in beta and might change based on feedback.
    Let me know you think about it after trying it out!
