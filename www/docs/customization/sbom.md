# Cataloging artifacts

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a description of the components that make
up a software artifact.

GoReleaser can create one or more SBOMs for any artifacts generated by
GoReleaser.

## Usage

The artifact cataloging step can analyze one or more artifacts generated by
GoReleaser and output one or more SBOM files into the dist directory.

The default is configured to create an SBOM for each archive produced with
[Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft).

To customize the artifact cataloging pipeline you can use the following options:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
sboms:
  - # ID of the sbom config, must be unique.
    #
    # Default: 'default'.
    id: foo

    # List of names of the SBOM documents created at this step
    # (relative to the dist dir).
    #
    # Each element configured is made available as variables. For example:
    #   documents: ["foo", "bar"]
    #
    # would make the following variables that can be referenced as template keys:
    #   document0: "foo"
    #   document1: "bar"
    #
    # Note that multiple sbom values are only allowed if the value of
    # "artifacts" is "any".
    #
    # Default:
    #   When "binary":   ["{{ .Binary }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}.sbom.json"]
    #   When "any":      []
    #   Otherwise:       ["{{ .ArtifactName }}.sbom.json"]
    # Templates: allowed.
    documents:
      - "${artifact}.spdx.json"

    # Path to the SBOM generator command
    #
    # Note: the process CWD will be set to the same location as "dist"
    #
    # Default: 'syft'.
    cmd: syft

    # Command line arguments for the command
    #
    # Default: ["$artifact", "--output", "spdx-json=$document", "--enrich", "all"].
    # Templates: allowed.
    args: ["$artifact", "--output", "cyclonedx-json=$document"]

    # List of environment variables that will be passed to the SBOM command as
    # well as the templates.
    #
    # Default: [ "SYFT_FILE_METADATA_CATALOGER_ENABLED=true" ].
    env:
      - FOO=bar
      - HONK=honkhonk

    # Which artifacts to catalog.
    #
    # Valid options are:
    # - any:        let the SBOM tool decide which artifacts available in
    #               the cwd should be cataloged
    # - source:     source archive
    # - package:    Linux packages (deb, rpm, apk, etc)
    # - installer:  Windows MSI installers (Pro only)
    # - diskimage:  macOS DMG disk images (Pro only)
    # - archive:    archives from archive pipe
    # - binary:     binaries output from the build stage
    #
    # Default: 'archive'.
    artifacts: archive

    # IDs of the artifacts to catalog.
    #
    # If `artifacts` is "source" or "any" then this fields has no effect.
    ids:
      - foo
      - bar

    # Whether this SBOM configuration is disabled.
    #
    # Default: 'true'.
    # Templates: allowed.
    # <!-- md:inline_version v2.10 -->.
    disable: true
```

### Available variable names

These environment variables might be available in the fields that are accept
templates:

- `${artifact}`: the path to the artifact that will be cataloged (unless
  "artifacts" config item is "any")
- `${artifactID}`: the ID of the artifact that will be cataloged (unless
  "artifacts" config item is "any")
- `${document}`: the SBOM filename generated (corresponds to `${document0}` if
  the "artifacts" config item is "any")
- `${document#}`: the SBOM filenames generated, where `#` corresponds to the
  list index under the "documents" config item (e.g. `${document0}`)

## Limitations

Container images generated by GoReleaser are not available to be cataloged by
the SBOM tool.
