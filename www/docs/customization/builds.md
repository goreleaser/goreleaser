# Builds (Go)

Builds can be customized in multiple ways.
You can specify for which `GOOS`, `GOARCH` and `GOARM` binaries are built
(GoReleaser will generate a matrix of all combinations), and you can change
the name of the binary, flags, environment variables, hooks and more.

Here is a commented `builds` section with all fields specified:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
builds:
  # You can have multiple builds defined as a yaml list
  - #
    # ID of the build.
    #
    # Default: Project directory name.
    id: "my-build"

    # Path to main.go file or main package.
    # Notice: when used with `gomod.proxy`, this must be a package.
    #
    # Default: `.`.
    main: ./cmd/my-app

    # Binary name.
    # Can be a path (e.g. `bin/app`) to wrap the binary in a directory.

!!! warning "GOAMD64, GORISCV64, GOPPC64, GO386, GOARM, GOARM64"

    You usually will need to specify the complete target in places like
    `targets` and `overrides`.
    This includes the `_{goamd64}` suffix, as well as the other
    GOARCH-specific values.

<!-- md:templates -->

!!! info

    First-class build targets are gathered by running:
    ```sh
    go tool dist list -json | jq -r '.[] | select(.FirstClass) | [.GOOS, .GOARCH] | @tsv'
    ```
    We also recommend reading the [official wiki about Go ports](https://go.dev/wiki/PortingPolicy#first-class-ports).

Here is an example with multiple binaries:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
builds:
  - main: ./cmd/cli
    id: "cli"
    binary: cli
    goos:
      - linux
      - darwin
      - windows

  - main: ./cmd/worker
    id: "worker"
    binary: worker
    goos:
      - linux
      - darwin
      - windows

  - main: ./cmd/tracker
    id: "tracker"
    binary: tracker
    goos:
      - linux
      - darwin
      - windows
```

The binary name field supports [templating](templates.md). The
following build details are exposed:

<!-- to format the tables, use: https://tabletomarkdown.com/format-markdown-table/ -->

| Key     | Description                       |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| .Os     | `GOOS`                            |
| .Arch   | `GOARCH`                          |
| .Arm    | `GOARM`                           |
| .Ext    | Extension, e.g. `.exe`            |
| .Target | Build target, e.g. `darwin_amd64` |

## Passing environment variables to ldflags

You can do that by using `{{ .Env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` in the template, for
example:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
builds:
  - ldflags:
   - -s -w -X "main.goversion={{.Env.GOVERSION}}"
```

Then you can run:

```sh
GOVERSION=$(go version) goreleaser
```

## Build Hooks

Both pre and post hooks run **for each build target**, regardless of whether
these targets are generated via a matrix of OSes and architectures or defined
explicitly.

In addition to simple declarations as shown above _multiple_ hooks can be
declared to help retaining reusability of config between different build
environments.

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
builds:
  - id: "with-hooks"
    targets:
      - "darwin_amd64"
      - "windows_amd64"
    hooks:
      pre:
        - first-script.sh
        - second-script.sh
      post:
        - upx "{{ .Path }}"
        - codesign -project="{{ .ProjectName }}" "{{ .Path }}"
```

Each hook can also have its own work directory and environment variables:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
builds:
  - id: "with-hooks"
    targets:
      - "darwin_amd64"
      - "windows_amd64"
    hooks:
      pre:
        - cmd: first-script.sh
          dir:
            "{{ dir .Dist}}"
            # Always print command output, otherwise only visible in debug mode.
          output: true
          env:
            - HOOK_SPECIFIC_VAR={{ .Env.GLOBAL_VAR }}
        - second-script.sh
```

All properties of a hook (`cmd`, `dir` and `env`) support
[templating](templates.md) with `post` hooks having binary artifact
available (as these run _after_ the build).
Additionally the following build details are exposed to both `pre` and `post`
hooks:

<!-- to format the tables, use: https://tabletomarkdown.com/format-markdown-table/ -->

| Key     | Description                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| .Name   | Filename of the binary, e.g. `bin.exe` |
| .Ext    | Extension, e.g. `.exe`                 |
| .Path   | Absolute path to the binary            |
| .Target | Build target, e.g. `darwin_amd64`      |

Environment variables are inherited and overridden in the following order:

- global (`env`)
- build (`builds[].env`)
- hook (`builds[].hooks.pre[].env` and `builds[].hooks.post[].env`)

## Go Modules

If you use Go 1.11+ with go modules or vgo, when GoReleaser runs it may try to
download the dependencies. Since several builds run in parallel, it is very
likely to fail.

You can solve this by running `go mod tidy` before calling `goreleaser` or
by adding a [hook][] doing that on your `.goreleaser.yaml` file:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
before:
  hooks:
    - go mod tidy
# rest of the file...
```

[hook]: hooks.md

## Define Build Tag

GoReleaser uses `git describe` to get the build tag. You can set
a different build tag using the environment variable `GORELEASER_CURRENT_TAG`.
This is useful in scenarios where two tags point to the same commit.

## Reproducible Builds

To make your releases, checksums and signatures reproducible, you will need to
make some (if not all) of the following modifications to the build defaults in
GoReleaser:

- Modify `ldflags`: by default `main.Date` is set to the time GoReleaser is run
  (`{{.Date}}`), you can set this to `{{.CommitDate}}` or just not pass the
  variable.
- Modify `mod_timestamp`: by default this is empty string — which means it'll be
  the compilation time, set to `{{.CommitTimestamp}}` or a constant value
  instead.
- If you do not run your builds from a consistent directory structure, pass
  `-trimpath` to `flags`.
- Remove uses of the `time` template function. This function returns a new value
  on every call and is not deterministic.

## A note about directory names inside `dist`

By default, GoReleaser will create your binaries inside
`dist/${BuildID}_${BuildTarget}`, which is a unique directory per build target
in the matrix.

Those names have no guarantees of remaining the same from one version to
another. If you really need to access them from outside GoReleaser, you should
be able to consistently get the path of a binary by parsing
`dist/artifacts.json`.

You can also set `builds.no_unique_dist_dir` (as documented earlier in this
page), but in that case you are responsible for preventing name conflicts.

### Why is there a `_v1` suffix on `amd64` builds?

Go 1.18 introduced the `GOAMD64` option, and `v1` is the default value for that
option.

Since you can have GoReleaser build for multiple different `GOAMD64` targets, it
adds that suffix to prevent name conflicts. The same thing happens for `arm` and
`GOARM`, `mips` and `GOMIPS` and others.

## Go's first class ports

The `targets` option can take a `go_first_class` special value as target, which
will evaluate to the list of first class ports as defined in the Go wiki.

You can read more about it
[here](https://go.dev/wiki/PortingPolicy#first-class-ports).

## Building shared or static libraries

GoReleaser supports compiling and releasing C shared or static libraries, by
configuring the [Go build mode](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Build_modes).

This can be set with `buildmode` in your build.
It now supports `c-shared` and `c-archive`. Other values will transparently be
applied to the build line (via the `-buildmode` flag), but GoReleaser will not
attempt to configure any additional logic.

GoReleaser will:

- set the correct file extension for the target OS.
- package the generated header file (`.h`) in the release bundle.

Example usage:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
builds:
  - id: "my-library"

    # Configure the buildmode flag to output a shared library
    buildmode: "c-shared" # or "c-archive" for a static library
```

## Complex template environment variables

Builds environment variables accept templates.

You can leverage that to have a single build configuration with different
environment variables for each platform, for example.

A common example of this is the variables `CC` and `CXX`.

Here are two different examples:

### Using multiple envs

This example creates once `CC_` and `CXX_` variable for each platform, and then
set `CC` and `CXX` to the right one:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
builds:
  - id: mybin
    binary: mybin
    main: .
    goos:
      - linux
      - darwin
      - windows
    goarch:
      - amd64
      - arm64
    env:
      - CGO_ENABLED=0
      - CC_darwin_amd64=o64-clang
      - CXX_darwin_amd64=o64-clang+
      - CC_darwin_arm64=aarch64-apple-darwin20.2-clang
      - CXX_darwin_arm64=aarch64-apple-darwin20.2-clang++
      - CC_windows_amd64=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gc
      - CXX_windows_amd64=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
      - 'CC={{ index .Env (print "CC_" .Os "_" .Arch) }}'
      - 'CXX={{ index .Env (print "CXX_" .Os "_" .Arch) }}'
```

### Using `if` statements

This example uses `if` statements to set `CC` and `CXX`:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
builds:
  - id: mybin
    binary: mybin
    main: .
    goos:
      - linux
      - darwin
      - windows
    goarch:
      - amd64
      - arm64
    env:
      - CGO_ENABLED=0
      - >-
        {{- if eq .Os "darwin" }}
          {{- if eq .Arch "amd64"}}CC=o64-clang{{- end }}
          {{- if eq .Arch "arm64"}}CC=aarch64-apple-darwin20.2-clang{{- end }}
        {{- end }}
        {{- if eq .Os "windows" }}
          {{- if eq .Arch "amd64" }}CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc{{- end }}
        {{- end }}
      - >-
        {{- if eq .Os "darwin" }}
          {{- if eq .Arch "amd64"}}CXX=o64-clang+{{- end }}
          {{- if eq .Arch "arm64"}}CXX=aarch64-apple-darwin20.2-clang++{{- end }}
        {{- end }}
        {{- if eq .Os "windows" }}
          {{- if eq .Arch "amd64" }}CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++{{- end }}
        {{- end }}
```
