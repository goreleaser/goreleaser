# Docker Images with Ko

You can also use [ko][] to build and publish Docker container images.

Please notice that ko will build your binary again.
That shouldn't increase the release times too much, as it'll use the same build
options as the [build][] pipe when possible, so the results will probably be
cached.

!!! warning

    When on `--snapshot` mode, Ko will publish the image to `ko.local`.
    If its a regular build, Ko will only run in the publishing phase.

!!! info

    For Ko to work you still need to login, either with `docker login` or
    something else.

Refer to [ko's project page][ko] for more information.

!!! warning

    Note that while GoReleaser's build section will evaluate environment
    variables for each target being built, Ko doesn't.
    This means that variables like `.Os`, `.Arch`, and the sorts, will not be
    available.

## Example

Here's a minimal example:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
before:
  hooks:
    - go mod tidy

builds:
  - env: ["CGO_ENABLED=1"]
    binary: test
    goos:
      - darwin
      - linux
    goarch:
      - amd64
      - arm64

kos:
  - repositories: [ghcr.io/caarlos0/test-ko]
    tags:
      - "{{.Version}}"
      - latest
    bare: true
    preserve_import_paths: false
    platforms:
      - linux/amd64
      - linux/arm64
```

This will build the binaries for `linux/arm64`, `linux/amd64`, `darwin/amd64`
and `darwin/arm64`, as well as the Docker images and manifest for Linux.

# Signing KO manifests

KO will add the built manifest to the artifact list, so you can sign them with
`docker_signs`:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
docker_signs:
  - artifacts: manifests
```
