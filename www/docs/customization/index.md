# Customization

GoReleaser can be customized by tweaking a `.goreleaser.yml` file.

You can generate an example config by running [`goreleaser init`](/cmd/goreleaser_init/) or start from scratch.

You can also check if your config is valid by running [`goreleaser check`](/cmd/goreleaser_check/), which will tell you if are using deprecated or invalid options.
