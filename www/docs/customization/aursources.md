# Arch User Repositories (Sources)

<!-- md:version v2.5 -->

After releasing to GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea, GoReleaser can generate and publish
a `PKGBUILD` to an _Arch User Repository_ based on sources.

!!! warning

    Before going further on this, make sure to read
    [AUR's Submission Guidelines](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_submission_guidelines).

This page describes the available options.

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yaml"
aur_sources:
  - # The package name.
    #
    # Note that since this integration creates a PKGBUILD to build from
    # source, per Arch's guidelines.
    # That said, GoReleaser will remove `-bin` suffix if its present.
    #
    # Default: ProjectName.

    # Empty means all IDs (no filter).
