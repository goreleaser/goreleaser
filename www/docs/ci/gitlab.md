# GitLab CI

To create GitLab releases and push images to a Docker registry, add a file
`.gitlab-ci.yml` to the root of the project:

```yaml
stages:
  - release

release:
  stage: release
  image: docker:stable
  services:
    - docker:dind

  variables:
    GORELEASER_IMAGE: goreleaser/goreleaser:latest

    # Optionally use GitLab's built-in image registry.
    # DOCKER_REGISTRY: $CI_REGISTRY
    # DOCKER_USERNAME: $CI_REGISTRY_USER
    # DOCKER_PASSWORD: $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD

    # Or, use any registry, including the official one.
    DOCKER_REGISTRY: https://index.docker.io/v1/

    # Disable shallow cloning so that goreleaser can diff between tags to
    # generate a changelog.
    GIT_DEPTH: 0

  # Only run this release job for tags, not every commit (for example).
  only:
    refs:
      - tags

  script: |
    docker pull $GORELEASER_IMAGE

    # GITLAB_TOKEN is needed to create GitLab releases.
    # DOCKER_* are needed to push Docker images.
    docker run --rm --privileged \
      -v $PWD:/go/src/gitlab.com/YourGitLabUser/YourGitLabRepo \
      -w /go/src/gitlab.com/YourGitLabUser/YourGitLabRepo \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -e DOCKER_USERNAME -e DOCKER_PASSWORD -e DOCKER_REGISTRY  \
      -e GITLAB_TOKEN \
      $GORELEASER_IMAGE release --rm-dist
```

In GitLab CI settings, add variables for `DOCKER_REGISTRY`, `DOCKER_USERNAME`,
and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` if you aren't using the GitLab image registry. If you are
using the GitLab image registry, you don't need to set these.

Add a variable `GITLAB_TOKEN` if you are using [GitLab
releases](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/releases/). The value should
be an API token with `api` scope for a user that has access to the project.

The secret variables, `DOCKER_PASSWORD` and `GITLAB_TOKEN`, should be masked.
Optionally, you might want to protect them if the job that uses them will only
be run on protected branches or tags.

Make sure the `image_templates` in the file `.goreleaser.yml` reflect that
custom registry!

Example:

```yaml
dockers:
-
  goos: linux
  goarch: amd64
  binaries:
  - program
  image_templates:
  - 'registry.gitlab.com/Group/Project:{{ .Tag }}'
  - 'registry.gitlab.com/Group/Project:latest'
```
