# Continuous Integration

GoReleaser was built from the very first commit with the idea of
running it as part of the CI pipeline in mind.

Let's see how we can get it working on popular CI software:

- [GitHub Actions](actions.md)
- [Azure Pipelines](azurepipelines.md)
- [Circle CI](circle.md)
- [Cirrus CI](cirrus.md)
- [Google CloudBuild](cloudbuild.md)
- [Codefresh](codefresh.md)
- [Drone](drone.md)
- [GitLab CI](gitlab.md)
- [Jenkins](jenkins.md)
- [Semaphore](semaphore.md)
- [Travis CI](travis.md)
