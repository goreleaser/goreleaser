# GoReleaser Pro

GoReleaser Pro is now available with some unique features such as:

- Ability to [include](/customization/includes/) config files (useful for common configurations);
- Improved global hooks and [global after hooks](/customization/hooks/);
- [Monorepo support](/customization/monorepo);
- [Custom template variables](/customization/templates/#custom-variables) (goes well with [includes](/customization/includes/)).

## Roadmap

The roadmap is not public (yet), but we do have a couple of ideas and your input is always welcome!
Once you buy it, feel free to [email me](mailto:carlos@becker.software?subject=GoReleaser%20Feature%20Suggestion) with your suggestions.

## Pricing & Sponsors

- The current pricing is "low" and is likely to increase as we keep adding more pro-only features;
- If you sponsor either the project or its developers, you [can ask for a discount](mailto:carlos@becker.software?subject=GoReleaser%20Coupon%20Request)!

## Enterprise support

I don't have a plan for that yet, but please [email me](mailto:carlos@becker.software?subject=GoReleaser%20Enterprise%20Support) if you are interested.

## Using GoReleaser Pro

When you buy it on [gumroad](https://gum.co/goreleaser), you'll get a license key.

You can then pass it to the `release` command either via the `--key` flag or the `GORELEASER_KEY` environment variable.
