Please, tell us what happened, what you expect would happen (or what used to happen, if this is a regression).

Also, share details about your environment: GoReleaser version, Go/Rust/Zig/etc version, OS/arch, if its on CI or local, etc.

Even better: if you can, please share a minimum reproducible project and how to consistently reproduce the bug.

Thank you for taking the time to report this.

PS: please delete this comment before submitting. Thank you!
